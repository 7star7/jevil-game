# JEVIL Fight
A recreation of the secret boss fight from Deltarune Chapter 1 in Godot 3.X. About that. It's a sketchy project, so don't mind it much.

It started as a Undertale recreation but ended up like this, for some reason.

## Features
At the moment, that is.

- Unfinished Jevil.
- Working graze, menus and somewhat battle system.
- Unfinished player characters.
- Very unfinished mod characters.

You can pretty much change the characters (in the code, `CHARACTER_DATA.gd` specifically), that *does* change the menus properly *and* the system actually can recognize it. It also reconigzes the choice depending of the character. You can even add a "character" through JSON files as an end-user. But that is the whole project. Also *one* Jevil attack.

Now, it's here in GitHub, in public sight. That *is* a feature too. Issues are not open right now, but once the project gains an actual shape, you will be able to complain of a real something.

## What to do
I (7star7) am going to rework some of the already added functions because I believe it could've been done better.

And finishing Jevil, because it's the whole point of it. And a release after that just to have it easier to anyone who doesn't want to donwload Godot, but it can't happen until it has:

1. To Jevil to have most of his attack. What's the point again?
1. A finishable battle. Both win and lose conditions.
2. More proper party manager. As in in-game.

I (7star7) don't know if to remake it for Godot 4.X since I prefer using 3.X since my PC can't into Modernityâ„¢. It wouldn't be hard to download the LTS version and run it, could it be? Perhaps until this one is **completely** finished.

## Notes
If Godot complains at the start up, it deactivates the plugin it's using. Just enable it as soon as it stops importing things. It's going to be fixed once I replace the plugin with its own code. The plugin came from [here](https://github.com/Digital-Sin/BitmapTextureFont).
