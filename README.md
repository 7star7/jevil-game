# JEVIL Fight
A recreation of the secret boss fight from Deltarune Chapter 1 in Godot 3.X. About that.

It started as a Undertale recreation but ended up like this, for some reason.

## Features
At the moment, that is.

- Unfinished Jevil.
- Working graze, menus and somewhat battle system.
- Unfinished player characters.
- Very unfinished mod characters.

You can pretty much change the characters (in the code, `CHARACTER_DATA.gd` specifically), that *does* change the menus properly *and* the system actually can recognize it. It also reconigze the choice depending of the character. You can even add a "character" through JSON files as an end-user. But that is the whole project. Jevil (or rather the battle) can do several attacks.

Now, it's here in GitHub, in public sight. That *is* a feature too. Issues are not open right now, but once the project gains an actual shape, you will be able to complain about something real.

## What to do
I'm going to rework some of the already added functions because I believe it could've been done better.
And finishing Jevil, because it's the whole point of it. Also for it to run 30 FPS or a triggerable option for that.

I don't know if remake it for Godot 4.X. I prefer using 3.X since my PC can't into Modernityâ„¢. I wouldn't be hard to download the LTS version and run it, could it be?

## Disclaimer
I don't own anything Deltarune, that's Toby Fox.
